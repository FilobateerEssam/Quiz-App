"Developed an interactive Quiz App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Quiz App offers a user-friendly interface, with timed questions and an intuitive format for users to respond to. It includes a set of five rules for playing the Quiz, which adds to the overall user experience. I used JavaScript to dynamically insert questions and options, and calculate the final score based on the user's responses. Additionally, I leveraged the FontAweome CDN to incorporate icons into the App."
